								<h4 class="card-title">Universal Century</h4>
								<p class="card-text">Universal Century (宇宙世紀 Uchū Seiki?, commonly abbreviated as UC) is one of the timelines of the Gundam anime metaseries, along with the first timeline to be created.</p>
								<p class="card-text">The Universal Century begins after humans begin to populate space, after construction of the first space colony side at Side 1 was completed. It has been the primary Gundam timeline, although only eight of the 17 animated or live-action projects released since 1995 have been strictly set in this timeline.</p>
								<p class="card-text">The Universal Century science is practical and makes use of true science including the Lagrangian point in space, the O'Neill cylinder as a living environment, and energy production from Helium-3 (named Minovsky Physics).</p>

								<h4 class="card-title">Future Century</h4>
								<p class="card-text">In G Gundam, the ruling elites left Earth for space colonies in the first year of Future Century. Two years after the migration, a full-scale war developed on Earth as each nation fought to gain control. The colonies formed the United Colonies Federation and regained control of the nations on Earth. The United Colonies Federation decides to end the conflict on Earth by holding a tournament called Gundam Fight every four years. The nation represented by the winning Gundam earns the right to lead Earth and the colonies for the next four years.</p>
								<p class="card-text">G Gundam takes place in F.C.60 during the 13th Gundam Fight, a time led by Neo Hong Kong, the winner of the 12th Gundam Fight.</p>

								<h4 class="card-title">After Colony</h4>
								<p class="card-text">The After Colony timeline, or AC for short, deals with the events of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and its follow-up New Mobile Report Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. This series is set in a universe in which the Gundams are the primary arm of the space colonies' resistance, rather than forming a small part of a larger army. The After Colony timeline ends sometime before the present-day events of Frozen Teardrop, and is continued in the Mars Century, or MC era, during which that novel takes place.</p>

								<h4 class="card-title">After War</h4>

								<p class="card-text">After War or AW refers to one of the timelines in the Gundam anime meta-series.</p>
								<p class="card-text">The After War period starts following the massive colony drops that brought an end to the 7th Space War and killed 99% of humanity living on the Earth's surface. The third of a series of Gundam anime's made in the 1990s that take place in an alternate universe, following the success of Mobile Fighter G Gundam and New Mobile Report Gundam Wing. In addition to an anime, the After War time line also contains three manga's. The first was a manga adaptation of the anime, with the second being a sequel called After War Gundam X: Under the Moonlight that introduces a new cast of characters. The third manga called After War Gundam X: Newtype Warrior Jamil Neate follows the adventure and missions of Jamil Neat, a principal character in the anime, before the end of the 7th Space War. The After War series shares some similarities with the Universal Century. It is also the first series outside of the Universal Century to use Newtypes.</p>

								<h4 class="card-title">Correct Century</h4>
								<p class="card-text">The Correct Century (aka Seireki) is the fictional timeline of the anime television series Turn A Gundam and its related projects.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Seireki is the theoretical result of a merging of the other timelines seen in Gundam prior to Turn A (it should be noted that the Anno Domini, Advanced Generation and Post Disaster timelines have not been officially confirmed to be included in the timelines that lead to the Correct Century). Set in an indeterminate number of years into the far-flung future, the Seireki (True History) is a universe in which all technology on Earth and human civilizations in space, except for the Moon, were destroyed – the culmination of mankind's "Black History." As a result, the technological level on Earth in this timeline is comparable to that of the Real World in the early 1900s.</p>		
								<p class="card-text">Seireki hints several times at the fact its past is the culmination of events from every previous Gundam series; however, the full truth is sealed away in the chronicles of the Black History, which is hidden on the moon – with confirmation in the form of footage of pivotal battles from the previous Gundam series. An attempt to recreate the Black History by Gym Ghingham becomes the focus of Turn A Gundam's plot when it nears its climax.</p>

								<h4 class="card-title">Cosmic Era</h4>
								<p class="card-text">The Cosmic Era is the fictional timeline of the anime television series Gundam SEED and its spinoff projects. This Gundam timeline is noted for its similarities with the Universal Century timeline started by the first Mobile Suit Gundam' series.</p>
								<p class="card-text">With Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, the Cosmic Era universe is the only other Gundam universe other than the Universal Century with multiple full-length TV series (though the Anno Domini and Post Disaster timelines had their respective 50-episode TV series split into two seasons). Before that, the second most developed universe was Gundam Wing's After Colony universe, with one TV series, one OVA series and a compilation movie. The Universal Century universe remains by far the most developed one, with four TV series, four OVA series, fifteen theatrical releases, and various specials.</p>

								<h4 class="card-title">Anno Domini</h4>
								<p class="card-text">Anno Domini is the timeline used by the anime television series Mobile Suit Gundam 00 and its spinoff projects. The timeline Anno Domini (abbreviated as AD or A.D) is derived from the real life term, which is the designation used to number years after the birth of Christ in the Julian and Gregorian calendar. The story of Gundam 00 is running within the same timeline as the present society is currently residing in, around 300 years into the future from today.</p>

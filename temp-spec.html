			<!-- mobile suit info -->
			<p>The GF13-017NJ Shining Gundam is a mobile fighter featured in the anime Mobile Fighter G Gundam. It was built by the nation of Neo Japan for the 13th Gundam Fight and piloted by the series' main protagonist Domon Kasshu, as well as occasionally his crew member/love interest Rain Mikamura.</p>
			<p>Technology & Combat Characteristics
				Designed by Rain's father, Dr. Mikamura, the Shining Gundam is equipped with two beam swords, two forearm-mounted beam cannons known as "Shining Shot", head-mounted Vulcan guns, shoulder-mounted machine cannons, and the signature "Shining Finger" technique. This attack focuses heat into the Gundam's hand, which causes it to glow green and allows it to easily crush the head of an enemy Gundam. It contains an Emotion Energy System, which if given enough input allows the Gundam to power up significantly, allowing it to channel the Shining Finger energy into one of the beam swords; creating a Shining Finger Sword, which is large and powerful. As the Shining Gundam does not carry a physical shield, the defensive capabilities of the Gundam rely on Domon himself.</p>

				<p>Normal Mode
					This form is the default mode of the Shining Gundam. It is used when Domon is fighting another opponent without the use of the Shining Finger.</p>

					<p>Battle Mode
						This is the first of the Shining Gundam's high-powered modes, which allows it to employ its devastating Shining Finger attack. In this form, the Gundam's arm covers pop out and its face armor opens for extra ventilation. This transformation increases the Shining Gundam's speed and offensive capabilities, but reduces its sensor effectiveness, adaptability, and defensive strength.</p>

						<p>Super Mode
							The second of the Shining Gundam's high-powered modes. In this form, the Shining Gundam's overall performance is increased by 50%, its speed and offensive power are more than doubled, and the panels of its armor open up to reveal a variety of cooling systems, boosters and field generators. The Super Mode is powered by the emotional energy of its pilot Domon, who at first could only attain this state when he lost control of his rage and passion. However, through the instruction of Schwarz Bruder, Domon learned to attain the serene state of mind of a true warrior, allowing him to activate the Super Mode at will.</p>

							<p>True Super Mode
								Similar to the regular Super Mode, but Shining Gundam changes to an all gold color. The overall capabilities of the unit are increased tremendously. However, this mode can only be used when Domon is in a state of complete calm. Later on after Domon had replaced the Shining Gundam with the GF13-017NJII God Gundam, both he and his fellow Shuffle Alliance Gundam fighters each achieved variations of Shining Gundam's True Super Mode; called Hyper Mode.</p>
